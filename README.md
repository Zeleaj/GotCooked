# GotCooked 🍳

**GotCooked** is a 2D cooking game developed as my freshman year final project using **JavaFX**.  
Players can interact with kitchen objects, collect ingredients, combine them into recipes, and serve dishes before time runs out.  
The game emphasizes player interaction, time management, and modular object-oriented design.
